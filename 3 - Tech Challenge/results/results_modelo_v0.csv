Lord Adair Turner not only challenges the consensus on short-term tactical approaches to regulation and macroeconomic management, but he forces the reader to think more deeply about the long term goals of policy, including unfettered growth and the role of the free market.""--Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University""Adair Turner insists that economics should analyze the world as it actually is and human beings as they actually are and avoid taking its simplifying assumptions too literally. In this short volume he sketches the elements of such an analysis and shows how they can be applied to policy problems of the day, from financial regulation and population growth to climate change and income inequality. No one who worries about the future of the economy -- and the planet -- will fail to be provoked.""--Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley""...With this book, Turner has proved that Britain still produces thinkers who combine ideas with practical experience.""--New Statesman""Adair Turner is the jewel in the crown of British public servants. He is one of a tiny minority in public life today capable of thinking and acting at the highest level.Economics After the Crisis, based on three lectures he delivered at the London School of Economics in 2010, is a thinking person's delight, not least for the clear and lucid way in which Turner sets out his arguments."" --Robert Skidelsky,The Times Literary Supplement","This book by Robbins is a collection of his lectures delivered at the London School of Economics in 1931.

134398,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Dancing In Cadillac Light,"Gr 5-8-It is 1968 and Jaynell Lambert, an 11-year-old girl from Moon, Texas, gives readers a peek into her life. In this quiet, sleepy town, Kimberly Willis Holt (Putnam, 2001) focuses on the relationships between family members and their poor neighbors, the Pickens. It illuminates the love, prejudices, and loss that occur within such a small circle, showing the effects on the characters and how it enlarges their world. Actress Kimberly Brown's reading translates the text into a visceral experience of place with her slow-paced, distinctive southern drawl. She maintains a steady, rhythmic momentum, yet pronunciates clearly, so northerners will understand the dialogue. This young actress, primarily known for her Broadway and TV roles, does an admirable job with this medium, but her reading does not transcend the text. Listeners are always hearing the story, rather than experiencing it. There is no distinctive voice for each character, not even Jaynell's eccentric Grandpap. This keeps the characters rather one-dimensional and empathy from readers at a minimum. Her limited range of voices makes this highly descriptive narrative a bit tedious and dull. Compared to the previous translations of Holt's novels to audiobooks--My Louisiana Sky (Listening Library, 1999) and When Zachary Came to Town (Listening Library, 2000)--this one is a disappointment.Tina Hudak, St. Bernard's School, Riverdale, MDCopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theAudio Cassetteedition.","The Dancing In Cadillac Light is a compact, lightweight LED light that can be attached to the underside of a car's hood.

139560,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton And The Discovery Of Earth's Antiquity,"In this engaging account of scientific discovery, Repcheck (an acquiring editor at Norton) aims to elevate the little-known Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726-1797) into the lofty company of Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin, as one who wrested modern science from the ""straight jacket of religious orthodoxy."" Hutton, claims Repcheck, was the first to propose that the earth was shaped not by a cataclysmic Great Flood, but rather by ""the inexorable forces of wind and rain, tides and storms, volcanoes and earthquakes"" over a far longer period than the 6,000 years biblical scholars said was the planet's age. Repcheck frames his narrative around Hutton's theory, weaving together the many historical threads that led to this paradigm shift in the conception of geological history. There aren't many popular histories of science that can hop from a thousand years of Church doctrine about the age of the earth to the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion of 1745 without missing a beat, but Repcheck's comfortable style and enthusiasm for his subject permeate his book. He does a fine job of laying out Hutton's theory in the context of the Scottish Enlightenment as well as its consequences for later thinkers (most notably Darwin). Repcheck's account should appeal to anyone who's curious about intellectual history, geologist or not. (June)claims, in his book The Seashell on the Mountaintop (see p. 59), that his subject, Nicolaus Steno, discovered the science of geology and challenged the 6,000-year-old age of the earth.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","James Hutton was a Scottish geologist who is widely regarded as the father of modern geology. He is best known for his theory of uniformitarianism, which states that the Earth's geological features are the result of gradual, slow changes over time. Hutton's theory contradicted the prevailing idea of catastrophism, which held that the Earth's features were the result of sudden, catastrophic events such as floods or volcanic eruptions. Hutton's theory was revolutionary at the time, as it provided a scientific explanation for the Earth's geological features that did not rely on supernatural or divine forces. Hutton's theory was later developed and refined by Charles Lyell, who is often credited with popularizing the theory of uniformitarianism. Hutton's theory of uniformitarianism is still widely accepted today and is a cornerstone of modern geology.

125791,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Surveying (10th Edition),"Surveying is essentially the science of measurement of the spatial positions of the features on or near the surface of the earth.  The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system (GPS), and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems (GIS/LIS).  Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant.  For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor.  Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data.    The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study.  References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book.    Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition.  Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly.  The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely.  Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS.  Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate.  In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program (TRANSFOR) to compute state plane coordinates.  The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text.    Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography.  Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation.    We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

When Mr. Pignati comes home unexpectedly, he's distraught and feels betrayed by the teens. They try to make it up to him by taking him to the zoo, where he learns that his beloved gorilla, Bobo, has died. This trauma causes the Pigman to have a fatal heart attack.
