Lord Adair Turner not only challenges the consensus on short-term tactical approaches to regulation and macroeconomic management, but he forces the reader to think more deeply about the long term goals of policy, including unfettered growth and the role of the free market.""--Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University""Adair Turner insists that economics should analyze the world as it actually is and human beings as they actually are and avoid taking its simplifying assumptions too literally. In this short volume he sketches the elements of such an analysis and shows how they can be applied to policy problems of the day, from financial regulation and population growth to climate change and income inequality. No one who worries about the future of the economy -- and the planet -- will fail to be provoked.""--Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley""...With this book, Turner has proved that Britain still produces thinkers who combine ideas with practical experience.""--New Statesman""Adair Turner is the jewel in the crown of British public servants. He is one of a tiny minority in public life today capable of thinking and acting at the highest level.Economics After the Crisis, based on three lectures he delivered at the London School of Economics in 2010, is a thinking person's delight, not least for the clear and lucid way in which Turner sets out his arguments."" --Robert Skidelsky,The Times Literary Supplement","""This book is a wonderful example of what the economist can do to make his or her work accessible to the general public....

Filled with beautiful full-color art that will delight young readers as they read and sing along with the beautiful music CD. Children can be secure in knowing that they can climb the highest mountain and can cross the widest sea, because they can become anything that God wants them to be.""","In 1971, when the first edition of I Am a Promise was published, the book was controversial. It was the first account of the Harlem Children's Center, an innovative school for black children that had opened in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. At the time, many educators were skeptical about the book's claims that Harlem Children's Center was making a difference. But since then, the school's success has been confirmed by scores of studies. Now, in this new edition, the book's author, Jane Hill, has updated the story. In addition to the original text, the new edition contains an introduction by James S. Coleman, a leading education researcher, and a new chapter by Hill that describes the school's success and its relationship to the Harlem Community School, which has since replaced the Harlem Children's Center. The new edition also contains a new preface by Bill Cosby and a new foreword by Coleman. In these new sections, Coleman and Cosby offer their own thoughts about the book's message and its impact."

He is the author of the novelExpendable. A Grand Prize winner of the Writers of the Future contest, he lives with his family in Canada.","Trapped is the sixth volume of the League of Peoples series, a space opera by Weber, the prolific author of the popular Honor Harrington series. In this volume, Weber takes a break from his usual military SF and explores a more political SF, with a focus on interstellar politics and diplomacy. The story begins with the assassination of the League's ruling body, the Council of Five. The League of Peoples is a loose federation of interstellar civilizations, each with their own technology level. It is the League's job to maintain the peace between the member worlds, and to this end they have a standing army of the League's Peace Forces, the Legions. The assassination of the Council of Five was carried out by the Viceroy, the leader of the Legions, and the story follows the ensuing civil war as the Legions attempt to eliminate the Viceroy. Weber, however, is more interested in the League itself, and the story is really about the interstellar politics that arise as the Legions attempt to eliminate the Viceroy and the Council attempts to prevent the Legions from doing so. The League has a long-standing policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of its member worlds, and the Council of Five is divided over whether to support the Legions or not. Weber is also interested in the politics within the Legions, and the story follows a group of young Legions, led by a charismatic young officer, who attempt to stage a coup. Weber has a lot on his mind, and his prose suffers as a result. His sentences are long and complex, and his paragraphs are often too long. His prose is at times almost impenetrable, and it is sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on. However, the story is interesting and thought-provoking, and it is clear that Weber has a lot of ideas about the politics of an interstellar civilization. Trapped is a thoughtful and interesting story, but it is also long and complex, and Weber's prose is sometimes almost unreadable. However, for Weber's fans, this is a must-read.Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
134398,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Dancing In Cadillac Light,"Gr 5-8-It is 1968 and Jaynell Lambert, an 11-year-old girl from Moon, Texas, gives readers a peek into her life. In this quiet, sleepy town, Kimberly Willis Holt (Putnam, 2001) focuses on the relationships between family members and their poor neighbors, the Pickens. It illuminates the love, prejudices, and loss that occur within such a small circle, showing the effects on the characters and how it enlarges their world. Actress Kimberly Brown's reading translates the text into a visceral experience of place with her slow-paced, distinctive southern drawl. She maintains a steady, rhythmic momentum, yet pronunciates clearly, so northerners will understand the dialogue. This young actress, primarily known for her Broadway and TV roles, does an admirable job with this medium, but her reading does not transcend the text. Listeners are always hearing the story, rather than experiencing it. There is no distinctive voice for each character, not even Jaynell's eccentric Grandpap. This keeps the characters rather one-dimensional and empathy from readers at a minimum. Her limited range of voices makes this highly descriptive narrative a bit tedious and dull. Compared to the previous translations of Holt's novels to audiobooks--My Louisiana Sky (Listening Library, 1999) and When Zachary Came to Town (Listening Library, 2000)--this one is a disappointment.Tina Hudak, St. Bernard's School, Riverdale, MDCopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theAudio Cassetteedition.","""One of the most important voices in Native American literature today."" -- Starred Review, Kirkus Reviews"
139560,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton And The Discovery Of Earth's Antiquity,"In this engaging account of scientific discovery, Repcheck (an acquiring editor at Norton) aims to elevate the little-known Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726-1797) into the lofty company of Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin, as one who wrested modern science from the ""straight jacket of religious orthodoxy."" Hutton, claims Repcheck, was the first to propose that the earth was shaped not by a cataclysmic Great Flood, but rather by ""the inexorable forces of wind and rain, tides and storms, volcanoes and earthquakes"" over a far longer period than the 6,000 years biblical scholars said was the planet's age. Repcheck frames his narrative around Hutton's theory, weaving together the many historical threads that led to this paradigm shift in the conception of geological history. There aren't many popular histories of science that can hop from a thousand years of Church doctrine about the age of the earth to the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion of 1745 without missing a beat, but Repcheck's comfortable style and enthusiasm for his subject permeate his book. He does a fine job of laying out Hutton's theory in the context of the Scottish Enlightenment as well as its consequences for later thinkers (most notably Darwin). Repcheck's account should appeal to anyone who's curious about intellectual history, geologist or not. (June)claims, in his book The Seashell on the Mountaintop (see p. 59), that his subject, Nicolaus Steno, discovered the science of geology and challenged the 6,000-year-old age of the earth.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","""The Man Who Found Timeis a book of rare grace and power, the story of a remarkable man and his remarkable discovery.""--James Burke, author ofThe Day of the DolphinandThe Brain and The Mind""Stonking, stupendous, stupendous, stupendous.""--The Sunday Times""Brilliantly told, with the lightest touch.""--The Independent""Brilliantly told, with the lightest touch.""--The Independent""Stonking, stupendous, stupendous, stupendous.""--The Sunday Times""Stonking, stupendous, stupendous, stupendous.""--The Sunday Times""Brilliantly told, with the lightest touch.""--The Independent""Stonking, stupendous, stupendous, stupendous.""--The Sunday Times"

125791,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Surveying (10th Edition),"Surveying is essentially the science of measurement of the spatial positions of the features on or near the surface of the earth.  The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system (GPS), and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems (GIS/LIS).  Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant.  For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor.  Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data.    The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study.  References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book.    Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition.  Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly.  The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely.  Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS.  Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate.  In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program (TRANSFOR) to compute state plane coordinates.  The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text.    Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography.  Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation.    We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

In the first title, as a result of a phone prank, high school sophomores John and Lorraine become friends with Mr. Pignati (the Pigman), an elderly widower. The conflicted teens feel alienated from everything, but the Pigman's enthusiasm for life soon spills over onto them. John and Lorraine go roller skating with their new friend, and he suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. The teens have a party at the Pigman's house, and his pig collection and some of his late wife's clothes are destroyed. When Mr. Pignati comes home unexpectedly, he's distraught and feels betrayed by the teens. They try to make it up to him by taking him to the zoo, where he learns that his beloved gorilla, Bobo, has died. This trauma causes the Pigman to have a fatal heart attack. InThe Pigman's Legacy, John and Lorraine discover that a homeless man is living in Mr. Pignati's abandoned house. Thinking that this is a chance for them to make up for what happened to the Pigman, they try to befriend the surly old man. After to Atlantic City to cheer up the man, they discover that the true legacy of the Pigman is love. Both stories are told in chapters that alternate between John and Lorraine's point of view, narrated by Charlie McWade and Eden Riegel who do an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life. An added bonus is a fascinating interview with Paul Zindel discussing his craft.

She and her family were black, and when the riot broke out, they were forced to flee their home. The author was only 7 years old at the time, and in her memoirs she attempts to reconstruct the events that led to the riot and the events that followed.

Written with a view to making it accessible to a wide audience, the authors make concerted efforts to avoid using calculus and linear algebra and, wherever needed, a low mathematical level is used for presentation. Rather than performing exploratory data analysis, the concentration here is on the use of prespecified models and preplanned analyses. Model assumptions are clearly stated, and checked through the use of residual plots rather than formal tests. All analyses are presented by using standard linear models under the assumption of normality. It is the experimentwise control of the error rate and confidence levels on which the presentation is focused as opposed to individual error rates and confidence levels. The popular ""Taguchi techniques"", used extensively in an industrial set-up, are included and appear throughout several chapters.The book contains enough material for an instructor to offer a course ranging from one semester to one year. An attractive feature of this book is the inclusion of numerous real experiments which were either run by students or extracted from published articles---thus bringing home to students the practical utility of statistical designs. The authors have done a commendable job in presenting, explaining, and elucidating the fundamental concepts of design and analysis of experiments through illustrative examples. A carefully selected set of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter for students to test their understanding of the material.--Mathematical Reviews","""This is an excellent book for the classroom and for anyone interested in learning about the design of experiments.""--Choice, 1/1/2009"

82869,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Cyborgs@Cyberspace?: An Ethnographer Looks to the Future,"A path-breaking work in anthropology and social theory, Hakken's study of our emerging online culture offers new ways of understanding human identities and interactions. Richly documented and powerfully argued, the book's provocative exploration moves beyond all the shabby platitudes about computers and society, placing the debate about cyberspace--its promise and pitfalls--on more solid foundations. -- Langdon Winner, author ofTheWhale and the ReactorChallenging the pervasive image of a computer revolution, Hakken insightfully demonstrates that information technology is better viewed as a new terrain of contestation than an ineluctable force. What's important is how the technology is perceived and which potentials people actually appropriate. Hakken's great strength lies in using interesting examples to map continuities in broader networks of social relations. He builds these into a sustained effort to reinvigorate general anthropology, uniquely extending the cyborg metaphor to link biological with cultural perspectives and treat technology and humanity in a unified frame. -- Gary Downey, author ofThe Machine in Me,Routledge, 1998Hakken combines his unique ethnographies of computing cultures in England, Norway, and Sweden with his long term involvement in theoretical and political discussions of advanced information technologies. In an impressive tour de force, he develops a rich anthropological account of possible meanings of cyberspace that confront the usual stereotypes. -- Randi Markussen, Aarhus University, DenmarkHakken remains an ethnographer grounding his understandings in the acts, statements, and opinions of real people in real settings. He is particularly good at puncturing technology-based visions that ignore social, cultural, political, and/or economic factors that do matter. -- -Gregory Finnegan,Harvard UniversityThis text offers a fascinating reflection on anthropological research on computing and social change. -- Ergonomics Abstracts, 2001, Volume 33, Number 3The author is passionate about his subject. He presents his thesis in a penetrating and incisive style and his argument is carefully crafted and eloquent...this thought provoking and compelling text draws our attention to powerful social and cultural change which is taking place in a random fashion mediated by this comparatively little monitored or explored arena. -- Ergonomics Abstracts, 2001, Volume 33, Number 3","""The book is a must-read for anyone interested in the future of technology....

79972,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Rough Weather (Spenser Mystery),"Spenser, the redoubtable Boston PI, struts his stuff in this 36th entry in the series, but may leave some readers wondering if his ethics will bear even casual examination. When Heidi Bradshaw hires Spenser to support her at her daughter's wedding on Tashtego Island in Buzzards Bay, Mass., an old nemesis of Spenser's, the Gray Man, who almost killed Spenser inSmall Vices(1977), also shows up on the island. Spenser is unable to prevent the kidnapping of the bride or the deaths that attend it. Assisted by a cadre of familiar players, Spenser persists in trying to find the missing bride in spite of warnings from the Gray Man. The trademark banter and snappy dialogue may seem more forced than natural. Spenser displays his machismo in dealing with a muscle builder and his detective skills in figuring out the Gray Man's connections to the case. A troubling conclusion produces one resolution and the promise of further consequences in the next installment.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Spenser, the Boston private investigator whose adventures have entertained readers for more than 30 years, has returned for his 50th case. In the tradition of his creator, mystery author Robert B. Parker, Spenser is a tough guy who lives by his own code of honor. In ""Rough Weather,"" he is called upon by the state attorney general to investigate the death of a Boston police officer. The officer had been found floating in the Charles River, and the AG wants to know if the death was an accident, suicide, or homicide. Spenser's investigation leads to a Boston senator and his wife, who are involved in a bitter divorce. The senator's wife, a beautiful young woman, has been seeing a younger man, and the senator has hired a private detective to investigate her activities. Parker's descriptions of Boston's gritty streets and its seedy underbelly are vivid and evocative, and Spenser's detective work is as fascinating as ever. This is a fine addition to the Spenser series, and Parker's fans will be pleased to read it. --David Pitt"
