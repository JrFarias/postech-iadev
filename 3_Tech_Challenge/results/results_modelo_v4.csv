Lord Adair Turner not only challenges the consensus on short-term tactical approaches to regulation and macroeconomic management, but he forces the reader to think more deeply about the long term goals of policy, including unfettered growth and the role of the free market.""--Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University""Adair Turner insists that economics should analyze the world as it actually is and human beings as they actually are and avoid taking its simplifying assumptions too literally. In this short volume he sketches the elements of such an analysis and shows how they can be applied to policy problems of the day, from financial regulation and population growth to climate change and income inequality. No one who worries about the future of the economy -- and the planet -- will fail to be provoked.""--Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley""...With this book, Turner has proved that Britain still produces thinkers who combine ideas with practical experience.""--New Statesman""Adair Turner is the jewel in the crown of British public servants. He is one of a tiny minority in public life today capable of thinking and acting at the highest level.Economics After the Crisis, based on three lectures he delivered at the London School of Economics in 2010, is a thinking person's delight, not least for the clear and lucid way in which Turner sets out his arguments."" --Robert Skidelsky,The Times Literary Supplement","The book examines the role that economic science plays in informing public policy. It argues for greater attention to be paid by policymakers to the underlying principles on which modern economics is based, rather than to the details of specific proposals put forward as solutions to problems. In so doing it provides an explanation of how markets operate in practice, together with examples from recent history showing why this matters when making decisions about future government intervention into the economy.The work begins with a brief review of the origins of mainstream neoclassical theory, before considering more fully some of the key concepts within contemporary microeconomics and macroeconomics. Examples are drawn throughout from current affairs both domestic and international. Particular emphasis is placed upon two areas where there has been much discussion over the past few years - climate change mitigation policies and financial regulation."

He is the author of the novelExpendable. A Grand Prize winner of the Writers of the Future contest, he lives with his family in Canada.","""In this stunning new novel from Hugo Award-winner Wil McCarthy, humanity has been reduced to savages by an alien species that considers them little more than pets.""
Trapped is the sixth book in The League of People series. It was released on October 16th, 2012.
The story takes place after the events depicted in The Simulacrum but before those found in The Well-Played Game and Unbound.
In the previous books it became apparent that aliens were using humans as slaves for their entertainment. This book focuses on how these beings have become trapped into slavery themselves.
It starts with an interview between two scientists, one human named Dr. Rachel Goldstein and another alien called Tumult. They are discussing some research done about humans and how they've evolved since being enslaved. Humans now exhibit various traits like addiction, kleptomania, etc., which didn't exist before enslavement. But what's interesting is that all these behaviours can be traced back to just four different genes in our DNA code - something we call 'the Four'. And while no-one knows exactly why or how this happened, there seems to be evidence suggesting it might not even be natural...
Dr. Goldstein thinks she may know who could tell her more about what went wrong though...someone known only as 'the Stranger' because he refuses to reveal himself. He sends her messages through anonymous emails saying things like ''I'm sorry'' over time until finally asking if she wants him dead too? So naturally when his ship comes crashing down near Earth everyone assumes it must belong to terrorists out looking for revenge against us! However once they find out who really owns that thing everything changes quickly enough..."

In this quiet, sleepy town, Kimberly Willis Holt (Putnam, 2001) focuses on the relationships between family members and their poor neighbors, the Pickens. It illuminates the love, prejudices, and loss that occur within such a small circle, showing the effects on the characters and how it enlarges their world. Actress Kimberly Brown's reading translates the text into a visceral experience of place with her slow-paced, distinctive southern drawl. She maintains a steady, rhythmic momentum, yet pronunciates clearly, so northerners will understand the dialogue. This young actress, primarily known for her Broadway and TV roles, does an admirable job with this medium, but her reading does not transcend the text. Listeners are always hearing the story, rather than experiencing it. There is no distinctive voice for each character, not even Jaynell's eccentric Grandpap. This keeps the characters rather one-dimensional and empathy from readers at a minimum. Her limited range of voices makes this highly descriptive narrative a bit tedious and dull. Compared to the previous translations of Holt's novels to audiobooks--My Louisiana Sky (Listening Library, 1999) and When Zachary Came to Town (Listening Library, 2000)--this one is a disappointment.Tina Hudak, St. Bernard's School, Riverdale, MDCopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theAudio Cassetteedition.",A book by James J.

139560,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton And The Discovery Of Earth's Antiquity,"In this engaging account of scientific discovery, Repcheck (an acquiring editor at Norton) aims to elevate the little-known Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726-1797) into the lofty company of Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin, as one who wrested modern science from the ""straight jacket of religious orthodoxy."" Hutton, claims Repcheck, was the first to propose that the earth was shaped not by a cataclysmic Great Flood, but rather by ""the inexorable forces of wind and rain, tides and storms, volcanoes and earthquakes"" over a far longer period than the 6,000 years biblical scholars said was the planet's age. Repcheck frames his narrative around Hutton's theory, weaving together the many historical threads that led to this paradigm shift in the conception of geological history. There aren't many popular histories of science that can hop from a thousand years of Church doctrine about the age of the earth to the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion of 1745 without missing a beat, but Repcheck's comfortable style and enthusiasm for his subject permeate his book. He does a fine job of laying out Hutton's theory in the context of the Scottish Enlightenment as well as its consequences for later thinkers (most notably Darwin). Repcheck's account should appeal to anyone who's curious about intellectual history, geologist or not. (June)claims, in his book The Seashell on the Mountaintop (see p. 59), that his subject, Nicolaus Steno, discovered the science of geology and challenged the 6,000-year-old age of the earth.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","""An extraordinary biography....

Ron Whistance-Smith, WAML Information Bulletin","The history of warfare in early modern Europe is one that has not been well-served by previous histories. There are many reasons for this, but perhaps most significant was that until recently it was possible to write about such events as if they were taking place on another planet. This book takes an entirely different approach. It looks at war from the viewpoint of those who fought it - whether generals or privates; officers or footsoldiers; soldiers of fortune or mercenaries. It also examines how people lived with conflict every day during these years.]]>"

125791,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Surveying (10th Edition),"Surveying is essentially the science of measurement of the spatial positions of the features on or near the surface of the earth.  The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system (GPS), and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems (GIS/LIS).  Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant.  For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor.  Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data.    The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study.  References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book.    Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition.  Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly.  The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely.  Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS.  Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate.  In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program (TRANSFOR) to compute state plane coordinates.  The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text.    Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography.  Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation.    We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

In the first title, as a result of a phone prank, high school sophomores John and Lorraine become friends with Mr. Pignati (the Pigman), an elderly widower. The conflicted teens feel alienated from everything, but the Pigman's enthusiasm for life soon spills over onto them. John and Lorraine go roller skating with their new friend, and he suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. The teens have a party at the Pigman's house, and his pig collection and some of his late wife's clothes are destroyed. When Mr. Pignati comes home unexpectedly, he's distraught and feels betrayed by the teens. They try to make it up to him by taking him to the zoo, where he learns that his beloved gorilla, Bobo, has died. This trauma causes the Pigman to have a fatal heart attack. InThe Pigman's Legacy, John and Lorraine discover that a homeless man is living in Mr. Pignati's abandoned house. Thinking that this is a chance for them to make up for what happened to the Pigman, they try to befriend the surly old man. After to Atlantic City to cheer up the man, they discover that the true legacy of the Pigman is love. Both stories are told in chapters that alternate between John and Lorraine's point of view, narrated by Charlie McWade and Eden Riegel who do an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life.

Titled ""The Lost Boys,"" this story was picked up by other news outlets across America. But what made it so remarkable? Wasn't there another case involving missing children around that same time period?
In fact yes! There were actually two cases where young boys went missing within weeks of each other back then...one involved five kids while the other consisted only three little ones. Both occurred right before my birthday month too which makes me wonder whether these tragedies somehow relate to myself as well.
I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this secret though since everyone else seems determined to share everything with others anyway!
A fascinating account of one man’s journey into his own past—and the history behind him—from bestselling author Andrew Carroll (Operation Homecoming) and former CIA officer Robert Baer (See No Evil).
On August 27th, 2009 at approximately noon local time a car bomb exploded outside the U.S Embassy compound killing nine people including Ambassador Chris Stevens. This attack came less than six months after President Obama announced plans for military intervention against ISIS forces advancing towards Baghdad. While many Americans may think we are finally getting serious about dealing once and for all with Islamic terrorists, few realize just how far away those goals still remain. And even fewer understand why they haven’t already achieved them yet despite spending billions upon billion dollars trying over decades now without success…
If you’ve seen some recent movies like Zero Dark Thirty or Argo perhaps your curiosity has gotten piqued enough to want more information about what really happened leading up to September 11th; maybe even learning exactly WHO did it would help put things into perspective better than anything Hollywood could possibly produce…"

The bounty it's after is the &quot;good guy&quot; of the tale--a waif-like being who invades the mind of a small girl to make its presence known. They both arrive in a hot, desolate West Texas town surrounded by the alkali dust and sagebrush of a flatland between mountains. And the battle begins. An unpretentious horror novel with memorable imagery,Stingeris this reviewer's favorite of Robert McCammon's. It has appealing characters. It has feuding motorcycle gangs. It even has a bit of aWest Side Storyromance between Anglo guy and Hispanic girl. Sure, it's a B-movie romp, but McCammon is earnest--he doesn't play it for laughs. The action is scary and horrifying, making for a long, satisfying read.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",The Stinger is an electronic device that uses electrical impulses to stimulate muscles.

75397,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Design and Analysis of Experiments (Springer Texts in Statistics),"This is a readable book presenting the basic concepts, principles, and techniques of design and analysis of experiments. Written with a view to making it accessible to a wide audience, the authors make concerted efforts to avoid using calculus and linear algebra and, wherever needed, a low mathematical level is used for presentation. Rather than performing exploratory data analysis, the concentration here is on the use of prespecified models and preplanned analyses. Model assumptions are clearly stated, and checked through the use of residual plots rather than formal tests. All analyses are presented by using standard linear models under the assumption of normality. It is the experimentwise control of the error rate and confidence levels on which the presentation is focused as opposed to individual error rates and confidence levels. The popular ""Taguchi techniques"", used extensively in an industrial set-up, are included and appear throughout several chapters.The book contains enough material for an instructor to offer a course ranging from one semester to one year. An attractive feature of this book is the inclusion of numerous real experiments which were either run by students or extracted from published articles---thus bringing home to students the practical utility of statistical designs. The authors have done a commendable job in presenting, explaining, and elucidating the fundamental concepts of design and analysis of experiments through illustrative examples. A carefully selected set of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter for students to test their understanding of the material.--Mathematical Reviews","This is an excellent book. It provides clear explanations about various experimental designs such as completely randomized design,
            randomized block design, factorial experiments etc., along with appropriate examples to illustrate these concepts."
31564,"Please provide a detailed description of the following product, including its features and any relevant specifications.",Applied Epidemiology: Theory to Practice,"""A distinguished all-American multi-author offering...Excellent chapters on Public Health Surveillance, Outbreak and Cluster Investigation, and Epidemiologic Issues in Community Interventions.""--Public Health","Applied epidemiologists are public health professionals who use scientific principles in their daily practice. They investigate disease outbreaks, conduct surveillance activities for emerging infections, plan control measures, evaluate programs, manage emergencies, and serve as liaisons between government officials, local communities, media representatives, healthcare providers, patients, industry leaders, and other interested parties. The goal is not simply to describe what an applied epidemiologist does but rather to explain how one thinks. This book provides guidance on thinking like an applied epidemiologist by presenting essential concepts from various fields that inform the day-to-day work of those engaged in infectious diseases prevention and control.
Applied Epidemiology: Theory To Practice helps students understand key theories related to population-level analysis; it also gives them insight into practical considerations necessary when applying these theoretical constructs in real-world settings. For example, Chapter 2 covers basic statistical methods used commonly during investigations while chapter three explores issues surrounding bias and confounding factors present within observational studies designed specifically around identifying risk behaviors associated with specific illnesses or conditions."

Richly documented and powerfully argued, the book's provocative exploration moves beyond all the shabby platitudes about computers and society, placing the debate about cyberspace--its promise and pitfalls--on more solid foundations. -- Langdon Winner, author ofTheWhale and the ReactorChallenging the pervasive image of a computer revolution, Hakken insightfully demonstrates that information technology is better viewed as a new terrain of contestation than an ineluctable force. What's important is how the technology is perceived and which potentials people actually appropriate. Hakken's great strength lies in using interesting examples to map continuities in broader networks of social relations. He builds these into a sustained effort to reinvigorate general anthropology, uniquely extending the cyborg metaphor to link biological with cultural perspectives and treat technology and humanity in a unified frame. -- Gary Downey, author ofThe Machine in Me,Routledge, 1998Hakken combines his unique ethnographies of computing cultures in England, Norway, and Sweden with his long term involvement in theoretical and political discussions of advanced information technologies. In an impressive tour de force, he develops a rich anthropological account of possible meanings of cyberspace that confront the usual stereotypes. -- Randi Markussen, Aarhus University, DenmarkHakken remains an ethnographer grounding his understandings in the acts, statements, and opinions of real people in real settings. He is particularly good at puncturing technology-based visions that ignore social, cultural, political, and/or economic factors that do matter. -- -Gregory Finnegan,Harvard UniversityThis text offers a fascinating reflection on anthropological research on computing and social change. -- Ergonomics Abstracts, 2001, Volume 33, Number 3The author is passionate about his subject. He presents his thesis in a penetrating and incisive style and his argument is carefully crafted and eloquent...this thought provoking and compelling text draws our attention to powerful social and cultural change which is taking place in a random fashion mediated by this comparatively little monitored or explored arena. -- Ergonomics Abstracts, 2001, Volume 33, Number 3","In this book, sociologist Malcolm Sparrow presents an ethnographic study that explores what it means to be human in cyberspace. He argues that while some people may see cyber-space as a dystopian future where humans are reduced to mere data points or objects for manipulation by algorithms, others view it as a place filled with endless possibilities. The author also examines how our identities change when we interact online versus offline; he suggests that there is no clear line between these two worlds but rather they coexist simultaneously within us all."

When Heidi Bradshaw hires Spenser to support her at her daughter's wedding on Tashtego Island in Buzzards Bay, Mass., an old nemesis of Spenser's, the Gray Man, who almost killed Spenser inSmall Vices(1977), also shows up on the island. Spenser is unable to prevent the kidnapping of the bride or the deaths that attend it. Assisted by a cadre of familiar players, Spenser persists in trying to find the missing bride in spite of warnings from the Gray Man. The trademark banter and snappy dialogue may seem more forced than natural.

This will help create harmony among different countries while preserving their unique cultures at same time.

The author discusses how this idea was conceived by various thinkers throughout history but never implemented until now due to lack of political support from leaders who prioritized economic development over social cohesion.
