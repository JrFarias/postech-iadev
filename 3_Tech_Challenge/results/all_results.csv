0,4083,The Pigman's Legacy,"Starred Review. Grade 8 Up&mdash;In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the publication of Paul Zindel's award-winning novel,The Pigman(HarperCollins, 1968), Zindel's son David has produced audiobook versions ofThe PigmanandThe Pigman's Legacy(Harper, 1980). In the first title, as a result of a phone prank, high school sophomores John and Lorraine become friends with Mr. Pignati (the Pigman), an elderly widower. The conflicted teens feel alienated from everything, but the Pigman's enthusiasm for life soon spills over onto them. John and Lorraine go roller skating with their new friend, and he suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. The teens have a party at the Pigman's house, and his pig collection and some of his late wife's clothes are destroyed. When Mr. Pignati comes home unexpectedly, he's distraught and feels betrayed by the teens. They try to make it up to him by taking him to the zoo, where he learns that his beloved gorilla, Bobo, has died. This trauma causes the Pigman to have a fatal heart attack. InThe Pigman's Legacy, John and Lorraine discover that a homeless man is living in Mr. Pignati's abandoned house. Thinking that this is a chance for them to make up for what happened to the Pigman, they try to befriend the surly old man. After to Atlantic City to cheer up the man, they discover that the true legacy of the Pigman is love. Both stories are told in chapters that alternate between John and Lorraine's point of view, narrated by Charlie McWade and Eden Riegel who do an outstanding job of bringing the characters to life. An added bonus is a fascinating interview with Paul Zindel discussing his craft. These remarkable audiobooks, which still offer important messages to today's teens, are a must-have for high school and public libraries.&mdash;Kathy Miller, Baldwin High School Baldwin City, KSEND--This text refers to theAudio CDedition.","The Pigman's Legacy is a fictional book written by John Grisham.

3,32661,Getting Rid of Gout,Bryan Emmerson is at University of Queensland.,"Getting rid of gout is a process that involves several steps, including reducing uric acid levels, managing weight, and maintaining a healthy diet. Here are some key points to consider when trying to get rid of gout:     1. Reduce uric acid levels: Uric acid is a waste product that is produced by the body and can build up in the blood. High levels of uric acid can cause gout attacks. To reduce uric acid levels, it is important to limit alcohol consumption, avoid high-purine foods such as red meat, organ meat, and shellfish, and take medication as prescribed by a doctor.     2. Manage weight: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of gout. Losing weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise can help reduce uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks.     3. Maintain a healthy diet: A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products can help reduce uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks. It is also important to limit intake of high-purine foods such as red meat, organ meat, and shellfish.     4. Manage stress: Stress can increase the risk of gout attacks. Managing stress through techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help reduce the risk of gout attacks.     5. Take medication as prescribed: Medication such as allopurinol and colchicine can help reduce uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks. It is important to take medication as prescribed and follow up with a doctor regularly to ensure that medication is working effectively.     6. Avoid triggers: Certain foods and beverages, such as alcohol and high-purine foods, can trigger gout attacks. Avoiding these triggers can help prevent gout attacks.     7. Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce stress, and prevent gout attacks. It is important to consult with a doctor before starting any exercise program.     8. Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep can help reduce stress and prevent gout attacks. It is important to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.     9. Avoid dehydration: Dehydration can increase the risk of gout attacks. It is important to drink enough water and other fluids to stay hydrated.     10.

This book is a timely and important contribution to the debate on the future direction of economic policy and is essential reading for anyone interested in economics and public policy."" -Sir Martin Sorrell, Chief Executive, WPP Group","Economics After the Crisis: Objectives and Means (Lionel Robbins Lectures)     Description:  The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Its effects were felt around the world. Economies shrank, unemployment rose, and governments were forced to spend billions of dollars on bank rescues and stimulus packages. In the United States, the crisis has led to a massive expansion of government spending, as well as to a dramatic increase in the national debt. But how did we get here? And what can we do to get out? In this new volume in the Lionel Robbins Lectures series, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Mundell offers a clear and accessible analysis of the current economic crisis. Mundell, a pioneer in the field of monetary economics, examines the causes of the crisis, as well as its consequences and the appropriate policy response. He argues that the crisis was caused by a failure to understand the role of money and monetary policy in an open economy. He also argues that the current expansionary fiscal policy is a mistake. The crisis, he says, can only be solved by a return to fiscal discipline and a new monetary policy regime. Mundell's analysis of the crisis and its aftermath will be of great interest to economists, policymakers, and anyone concerned with the future of the global economy.     Author:  Robert A. Mundell     Publisher:  Cambridge University Press     Pages:  120","""This book is a wonderful example of what the economist can do to make his or her work accessible to the general public.... Professor Friedman has succeeded in making the book accessible to a wide audience, and it is a must read for anyone interested in the current economic crisis."" --Choice","The book examines the role that economic science plays in informing public policy. It argues for greater attention to be paid by policymakers to the underlying principles on which modern economics is based, rather than to the details of specific proposals put forward as solutions to problems. In so doing it provides an explanation of how markets operate in practice, together with examples from recent history showing why this matters when making decisions about future government intervention into the economy.The work begins with a brief review of the origins of mainstream neoclassical theory, before considering more fully some of the key concepts within contemporary microeconomics and macroeconomics. Examples are drawn throughout from current affairs both domestic and international. Particular emphasis is placed upon two areas where there has been much discussion over the past few years - climate change mitigation policies and financial regulation."

It was the first account of the Harlem Children's Center, an innovative school for black children that had opened in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. At the time, many educators were skeptical about the book's claims that Harlem Children's Center was making a difference. But since then, the school's success has been confirmed by scores of studies. Now, in this new edition, the book's author, Jane Hill, has updated the story. In addition to the original text, the new edition contains an introduction by James S. Coleman, a leading education researcher, and a new chapter by Hill that describes the school's success and its relationship to the Harlem Community School, which has since replaced the Harlem Children's Center. The new edition also contains a new preface by Bill Cosby and a new foreword by Coleman.

Overall, this is a well-written and enjoyable read.""","Trapped is the sixth volume of the League of Peoples series, a space opera by Weber, the prolific author of the popular Honor Harrington series. In this volume, Weber takes a break from his usual military SF and explores a more political SF, with a focus on interstellar politics and diplomacy. The story begins with the assassination of the League's ruling body, the Council of Five. The League of Peoples is a loose federation of interstellar civilizations, each with their own technology level. It is the League's job to maintain the peace between the member worlds, and to this end they have a standing army of the League's Peace Forces, the Legions. The assassination of the Council of Five was carried out by the Viceroy, the leader of the Legions, and the story follows the ensuing civil war as the Legions attempt to eliminate the Viceroy. Weber, however, is more interested in the League itself, and the story is really about the interstellar politics that arise as the Legions attempt to eliminate the Viceroy and the Council attempts to prevent the Legions from doing so. The League has a long-standing policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of its member worlds, and the Council of Five is divided over whether to support the Legions or not. Weber is also interested in the politics within the Legions, and the story follows a group of young Legions, led by a charismatic young officer, who attempt to stage a coup. Weber has a lot on his mind, and his prose suffers as a result. His sentences are long and complex, and his paragraphs are often too long. His prose is at times almost impenetrable, and it is sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on. However, the story is interesting and thought-provoking, and it is clear that Weber has a lot of ideas about the politics of an interstellar civilization. Trapped is a thoughtful and interesting story, but it is also long and complex, and Weber's prose is sometimes almost unreadable. However, for Weber's fans, this is a must-read.Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","""In this stunning new novel from Hugo Award-winner Wil McCarthy, humanity has been reduced to savages by an alien species that considers them little more than pets.""

The story takes place after the events depicted in The Simulacrum but before those found in The Well-Played Game and Unbound.
In the previous books it became apparent that aliens were using humans as slaves for their entertainment. This book focuses on how these beings have become trapped into slavery themselves.
It starts with an interview between two scientists, one human named Dr. Rachel Goldstein and another alien called Tumult. They are discussing some research done about humans and how they've evolved since being enslaved. Humans now exhibit various traits like addiction, kleptomania, etc., which didn't exist before enslavement. But what's interesting is that all these behaviours can be traced back to just four different genes in our DNA code - something we call 'the Four'. And while no-one knows exactly why or how this happened, there seems to be evidence suggesting it might not even be natural...
Dr. Goldstein thinks she may know who could tell her more about what went wrong though...someone known only as 'the Stranger' because he refuses to reveal himself. He sends her messages through anonymous emails saying things like ''I'm sorry'' over time until finally asking if she wants him dead too? So naturally when his ship comes crashing down near Earth everyone assumes it must belong to terrorists out looking for revenge against us! However once they find out who really owns that thing everything changes quickly enough..."

Written with a view to making it accessible to a wide audience, the authors make concerted efforts to avoid using calculus and linear algebra and, wherever needed, a low mathematical level is used for presentation. Rather than performing exploratory data analysis, the concentration here is on the use of prespecified models and preplanned analyses. Model assumptions are clearly stated, and checked through the use of residual plots rather than formal tests. All analyses are presented by using standard linear models under the assumption of normality. It is the experimentwise control of the error rate and confidence levels on which the presentation is focused as opposed to individual error rates and confidence levels. The popular ""Taguchi techniques"", used extensively in an industrial set-up, are included and appear throughout several chapters.The book contains enough material for an instructor to offer a course ranging from one semester to one year. An attractive feature of this book is the inclusion of numerous real experiments which were either run by students or extracted from published articles---thus bringing home to students the practical utility of statistical designs.

What's important is how the technology is perceived and which potentials people actually appropriate.

Secret Witness  is the first book to tell the story of the bombing from the perspective of the people who were there. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of the civil rights movement.""--Michael P. Fitts, President, University of Pennsylvania","In 1967, a bomb destroyed the home of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Detroit, Michigan, leaving the reverend and his family shaken but unharmed. The bombing, the most serious of three attempts on King's life, was the work of a group of racist thugs who called themselves the White Panthers. This book is the story of the bombing and the subsequent investigation that led to the arrest of the bombers. It is also the story of the bombing's effect on the lives of the King family, and on the life of the investigator who took the case, John Freeman, a young African American detective in the Detroit police force. Freeman's investigation led to the arrest and conviction of the bombers. Freeman's life, however, was forever changed by the bombing, and by the people and events that surrounded it.","The author of the popular novel The Color Purple (LJ 9/15/79) here recounts the story of the 1967 race riot in the small Michigan town of Marshall, where she spent the first two years of her life. She and her family were black, and when the riot broke out, they were forced to flee their home. The author was only 7 years old at the time, and in her memoirs she attempts to reconstruct the events that led to the riot and the events that followed. She also describes her family's life in the segregated south and her family's move to Detroit in the 1950s. The author's account of the riot is well written, and the descriptions of the riot are vivid. However, the book is at its best when she writes of her childhood and her family. Her parents' strength and determination in the face of adversity is inspiring, and the author's account of the 1967 riot is less successful because it is so closely tied to her family's history.

It told about the unsolved murder of four black men who had been kidnapped from their homes on July 23rd, 1967 during the worst civil unrest ever experienced by our nation's second largest city--Detroit. Titled ""The Lost Boys,"" this story was picked up by other news outlets across America. But what made it so remarkable? Wasn't there another case involving missing children around that same time period?
In fact yes! There were actually two cases where young boys went missing within weeks of each other back then...one involved five kids while the other consisted only three little ones. Both occurred right before my birthday month too which makes me wonder whether these tragedies somehow relate to myself as well.
I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this secret though since everyone else seems determined to share everything with others anyway!
A fascinating account of one man’s journey into his own past—and the history behind him—from bestselling author Andrew Carroll (Operation Homecoming) and former CIA officer Robert Baer (See No Evil).
On August 27th, 2009 at approximately noon local time a car bomb exploded outside the U.S Embassy compound killing nine people including Ambassador Chris Stevens. This attack came less than six months after President Obama announced plans for military intervention against ISIS forces advancing towards Baghdad. While many Americans may think we are finally getting serious about dealing once and for all with Islamic terrorists, few realize just how far away those goals still remain. And even fewer understand why they haven’t already achieved them yet despite spending billions upon billion dollars trying over decades now without success…

Dutton describes how scholastic humanism, which was a synthesis of classical and Christian thought, was developed in the schools of the monastic orders and then in the universities, where it became the dominant philosophy. The author examines the development of scholastic humanism from the Carolingian Renaissance to the High Middle Ages, and he discusses the scholastic humanist movement's most important thinkers, including Anselm, Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard, and Thomas Aquinas. Dutton also discusses the scholastic humanist movement's influence on the development of science, philosophy, and literature.","""A remarkable and original work of scholarship."" --The Times Higher Education","The book is about an emerging movement in Europe known as ""Scholastic humanism"" that has been gaining momentum since 2014. It seeks to unify European nations under one common cultural identity based on traditional values such as family unity, respect for elders, patriotism, religious tolerance etc.. This will help create harmony among different countries while preserving their unique cultures at same time.

The author discusses how this idea was conceived by various thinkers throughout history but never implemented until now due to lack of political support from leaders who prioritized economic development over social cohesion. He argues that current situation where some EU members are trying hard to keep refugees out while others welcome them shows there needs more effort towards establishing true unity across continent rather than just focusing solely upon monetary benefits without considering long term consequences like rising nationalism which could lead civil unrests later down road."

22,125791,Surveying (10th Edition),"Surveying is essentially the science of measurement of the spatial positions of the features on or near the surface of the earth.  The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system (GPS), and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems (GIS/LIS).  Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant.  For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor.  Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data.    The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study.  References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book.    Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition.  Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly.  The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely.  Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS.  Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate.  In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program (TRANSFOR) to compute state plane coordinates.  The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text.    Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography.  Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation.    We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

24,134398,Dancing In Cadillac Light,"Gr 5-8-It is 1968 and Jaynell Lambert, an 11-year-old girl from Moon, Texas, gives readers a peek into her life. In this quiet, sleepy town, Kimberly Willis Holt (Putnam, 2001) focuses on the relationships between family members and their poor neighbors, the Pickens. It illuminates the love, prejudices, and loss that occur within such a small circle, showing the effects on the characters and how it enlarges their world. Actress Kimberly Brown's reading translates the text into a visceral experience of place with her slow-paced, distinctive southern drawl. She maintains a steady, rhythmic momentum, yet pronunciates clearly, so northerners will understand the dialogue. This young actress, primarily known for her Broadway and TV roles, does an admirable job with this medium, but her reading does not transcend the text. Listeners are always hearing the story, rather than experiencing it. There is no distinctive voice for each character, not even Jaynell's eccentric Grandpap. This keeps the characters rather one-dimensional and empathy from readers at a minimum. Her limited range of voices makes this highly descriptive narrative a bit tedious and dull.

25,139560,The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton And The Discovery Of Earth's Antiquity,"In this engaging account of scientific discovery, Repcheck (an acquiring editor at Norton) aims to elevate the little-known Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726-1797) into the lofty company of Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin, as one who wrested modern science from the ""straight jacket of religious orthodoxy."" Hutton, claims Repcheck, was the first to propose that the earth was shaped not by a cataclysmic Great Flood, but rather by ""the inexorable forces of wind and rain, tides and storms, volcanoes and earthquakes"" over a far longer period than the 6,000 years biblical scholars said was the planet's age. Repcheck frames his narrative around Hutton's theory, weaving together the many historical threads that led to this paradigm shift in the conception of geological history. There aren't many popular histories of science that can hop from a thousand years of Church doctrine about the age of the earth to the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion of 1745 without missing a beat, but Repcheck's comfortable style and enthusiasm for his subject permeate his book. He does a fine job of laying out Hutton's theory in the context of the Scottish Enlightenment as well as its consequences for later thinkers (most notably Darwin). Repcheck's account should appeal to anyone who's curious about intellectual history, geologist or not. (June)claims, in his book The Seashell on the Mountaintop (see p. 59), that his subject, Nicolaus Steno, discovered the science of geology and challenged the 6,000-year-old age of the earth.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.","James Hutton was a Scottish geologist who is widely regarded as the father of modern geology. He is best known for his theory of uniformitarianism, which states that the Earth's geological features are the result of gradual, slow changes over time. Hutton's theory contradicted the prevailing idea of catastrophism, which held that the Earth's features were the result of sudden, catastrophic events such as floods or volcanic eruptions. Hutton's theory was revolutionary at the time, as it provided a scientific explanation for the Earth's geological features that did not rely on supernatural or divine forces. Hutton's theory was later developed and refined by Charles Lyell, who is often credited with popularizing the theory of uniformitarianism. Hutton's theory of uniformitarianism is still widely accepted today and is a cornerstone of modern geology.
